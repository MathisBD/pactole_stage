This repository stores the Coq code of the Pactole project,
dedicated to formal verification of mobile robotic swarm protocols.

# Overall Structure

- *Setting.v*: All you need to setup a working framework. A good starting point.

- *Spaces/*: Spaces in which robots evolve
- *Observations/*: Types of robot views of the configuration
- *Models/*: Additional properties of some models
- *CasesStudies/*
  - *Convergence/*: Convergence of robots in the 2D Euclidean plane
  - *Gathering/*: Gathering in R or RÂ² for various models
  - *Exploration/*: Exploration of a ring with stop



# Fast Compiling when developing

During development you can benefit from coq's "vos/vok" generation to
speed up compilation. The only specificity of Pactole concerns
compilation of the files named xxx_Assumptions.v. This files print the
sets of assumptions used in the proofs of final lemmas in Case
studies. Compiling these files for vos/vok target would raise errors.
We provide adapted targets:

## Very fast but unsafe

make [-j] vos-nocheck

Replaces "make vos". Prefer this when developing.

### proofgeneral

For easy use of this feature you can use the auto compilation feature
of proofgeneral. menu:

menu: Coq / Auto Compilation / Compile Before Require
and then: Coq / Auto Compilation / vos compilation

Now you can transparently script in any buffer, all needed file will
be compiled quickly. Don't forget to make a big fat "make" from time
to time.

## slow, almost safe, very parallelisable

make [-j] vok-nocheck

replaces "make vok". Prefer this once a day.

## Completely safe

make [-j]

This is the only way to make a really safe compilation including all
xxx_Assumption.v. You should always do this once in a while to make
sure some universe constraints aren't failing and to check if you did
not miss an remaining axiom.
